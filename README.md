The code begins by defining a function named is_prime() that takes an integer n as its parameter. The function starts with a check to see if n is less than or equal to 1, as prime numbers are defined to be greater than 1. If n is indeed less than or equal to 1, the function immediately returns False to indicate that it is not a prime number.

Next, the function enters a loop that iterates from 2 up to the square root of n (inclusive). This optimization is possible because any factor of n must be less than or equal to its square root. Inside the loop, the code checks if n is divisible evenly by the current number in the iteration. If a divisor is found, i.e., n % i == 0, the function returns False, indicating that n is not a prime number.

If the loop completes without finding any divisors, it means that n is only divisible by 1 and itself, satisfying the definition of a prime number. In this case, the function returns True to indicate that n is a prime number.

The code also includes an example usage section. It prompts the user to enter a number using the input() function and converts the input to an integer. It then calls the is_prime() function, passing the entered number as an argument. Depending on the return value, the code prints an appropriate message stating whether the number is prime or not.
